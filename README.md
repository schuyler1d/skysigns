ASL SignWriting Dictionary

Learn sign language so you can chat and flirt at death metal concerts and loud bars!  Also tap into the rich American Deaf culture.

This application is targeted to those familiar with at least the alphabet and several signs.  Using SignWriting, an ideographic writing system for sign language, we store over 8000 signs on your device without the need for an Internet connection.  The icons communicate hand shape, context and movement, but there are no illustrations or videos.  If you are looking for a smaller dictionary with easy-to-understand illustrations, try "ASL Ultimate" on the Android.
