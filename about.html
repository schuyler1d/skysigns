	  <h2>SignWriting</h2>
	  <p>
	    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.signwriting.org/">SignWriting</a> was
	    developed by Valerie Sutton to express dance positions and
	    movement.  Since then, it has been adapted for
	    transcribing sign languages around the world.
	  </p>
	  <p>It may look confusing at first, but it's very easy to learn.
	    The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.signwriting.org/">SignWriting
	    website</a> has a lot of documentation, but the best
	    primer (until I can incorporate one into this app) is in
	    PDF available on the site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.signwriting.org/spain/lecciones/">http://www.signwriting.org/spain/lecciones/</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Credits</h2>
	  <p>This mobile app was developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://skyb.us/">Schuyler Duveen</a>, however most of the important work: the writing system, the font and the dictionary was done by those in the SignBank and SignPuddle community.</p>
	  <h3>Dictionary</h3>
	  <p>The current US Dictionary was downloaded as an export from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.signbank.org/SignPuddle1.6/index.php?ui=1&sgn=4">SignPuddle site</a>.  Developed by Stephen E Slevinski Jr., he and many contributors have added words (and you can too).</p>

          <p>Since some mobile platforms don't support SVG (*cough* Android *cough*), I'm
             very grateful that someone wrote a converter, since the above ISWA font is
             represented in SVG.
