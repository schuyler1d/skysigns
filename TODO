PhoneGap/Mobile Issues
----------------------
* Android doesn't support SVG -- need to use canvas
  http://appsynergy.net/2010/08/14/converting-svg-path-to-html5-canvas/
* iOS observes the DB quota and seems to hover around 2.75M as the maximum
   -- though I wonder if I'm splitting up my space, and it depends on how much storage is already used up, etc. -- either way, the division between localStorage and webSQL makes sense here, even if it's slower
