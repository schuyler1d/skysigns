* skylog()
* phonegap-deviceready
* show download progress

* break up paths/shapes/dict into separate files
* need to import phonegap.js on the various platforms for PhoneGap.File API
* iPhone? include phonegap storage.js for openDatabase
* implement flexible storage for paths,shapes so they can be in sql/localStorage/memory
* display sign within boundary
   example: 'attractive' sign is too tall, 
            'alseep soundly' too tall cutoff on bottom

PhoneGap/Mobile Issues
----------------------
* Android doesn't support SVG -- need to use canvas
  http://appsynergy.net/2010/08/14/converting-svg-path-to-html5-canvas/
* iOS observes the DB quota and seems to hover around 2.75M as the maximum
   -- though I wonder if I'm splitting up my space, and it depends on how much storage is already used up, etc. -- either way, the division between localStorage and webSQL makes sense here, even if it's slower
